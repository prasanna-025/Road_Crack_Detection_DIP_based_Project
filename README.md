Road Crack Detection Using Digital Image Processing

This project implements a classical image processing-based approach to detect and analyze road surface cracks from static images and real-time IP camera streams. The system uses advanced preprocessing techniques such as Non-Local Means Denoising, CLAHE, Gaussian Blur, Gabor Filtering, and Morphological Operations to enhance crack visibility.

Canny Edge Detection and contour extraction are used to identify cracks, and arc length computation is applied to measure crack dimensions in real time. The system provides visual overlays, histogram analysis, and multi-stage visualization for better interpretability.

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
